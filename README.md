# vimfiles
My Vim configuration (vimrc and plugins)

## Notes
1. Line endings may need work if installing cross-platform
2. Vim's `listchars` may also need to change for various encodings

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Symlink `vimrc.vim` in your home directory as `.vimrc` (Linux) or `_vimrc` (Windows)
3. Enjoy!

### How to Symlink in Windows
1. Open a (Administrator?) command line (cmd.exe)
2. Type the command `mklink _vimrc vimfiles\vimrc.vim`
3. Done!
